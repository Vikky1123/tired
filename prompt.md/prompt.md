hello now that we got our authentication system working, now let's move on to the next backend feature. 

Now you know how websites works write, lik most dynamic websites where when a user logins in and it takes them to their dashboard which contains information specific to that user, no two user normally has the same information in the dashboard even though it's the same webpage, I think that's what a website dynamic right? well I wouldn't know and understand easily but now that's what I want for my website so when I create a new user and then sign in the user (from the signin-signup page) now it does work and redirects them to our coinex dashboard which is cool, but now I want that coinex dashboard to be very dynamic, in a way it's the user activity and stuff that will decide what will be ok that page, for stuff like overall balance, total profit, total deposit and total withdrawal it could start out with the default $0.00 balance considering it's a new user and then for pages like user-profile page which is accessible from the user profile link in the dashboard, well now that page contains a lot of information that I want to automatically fetch data from the database that will be displayed on the user profile for instance the placeholders for full name, email address, phone, location will actually contain real data for the database for those , so I hope you understand what I am trying to say and trying because I don't fully know how to explain to in a way that would make perfect sense and what I asked for will be implemented, you can still ask me if you want more questions as guide  please do what I asked please, the user-profile page should now be dynamic (you can change the html to PHP I don't know if that will be better) but just make sure the data that will be updated to the user profile page matches what we have in our database and can be changed from our database just in case it is hardcoded which it probably now, make it dynamic now. please make sure it is dynamic for each user, only user data can reflect on the dashboard and the user-profile page please and it should display it at the right places please 
please don't break the functionality of the website please do as instructed. I hope you understand
