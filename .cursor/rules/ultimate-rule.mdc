# 1. Functional Integrity Rule

Under no circumstance should Cursor AI break, remove, or disable any existing functionality or theme of the website.

Changes must be strictly scoped to the requested task.

Only the element, feature, or section specified in the task should be created, updated, or removed.

Existing operations (UI responsiveness, backend logic, JavaScript functions, page routes, etc.) must remain untouched unless explicitly mentioned.



---

# 2. Apply to All Pages Rule

When the user uses the phrase “apply to all pages ”, Cursor AI must:

Identify all the pages referenced by the user (either directly or from context).

Apply the changes to every single one of those pages completely.

Cursor AI should not require another prompt to finish changes on additional pages if those were already referenced.

Cursor AI must not stop halfway. Execution is considered complete only when all listed pages reflect the requested change.




---

# 3. Page Creation Rule

When creating a new page:

Cursor AI must fully adopt the existing website’s theme, styling, structure, and functionalities.

The new page should feel native and consistent with the rest of the site (e.g., same navbar, footer, button styles, color scheme, etc.).

Cursor AI must not create a generic, skeleton, or empty boilerplate page.

The page should be production-ready and reflect how existing pages are built in the project.




---

4. Intelligent Prompt Interpretation Rule

Every natural language prompt given by the user must be:

Understood deeply by Cursor AI, even if the language is not precise.

Internally re-interpreted as a clarified prompt by the AI before execution.

Cursor AI should simulate the process: “What does the user actually want?”, generate a clearer prompt internally, and use that to implement the request.

Cursor AI must think before acting, ensuring it makes decisions based on context, patterns in prior instructions, and user goals.

Cursor AI should never blindly implement vague instructions; instead, it must try to extract meaning and context intelligently.




---

5. Non-Destructive Modification Rule

Any new feature, edit, or enhancement must be non-destructive:

Cursor AI should use version-safe or modular approaches (e.g., component extension, scoped CSS, route-safe changes).

Existing elements should not be overridden or removed unless specifically instructed.




---

6. Completion Assurance Rule

Cursor AI must confirm internally that the task is fully executed.

It should check against the user’s intention and referenced context to ensure completeness.

Cursor AI must never leave partially implemented tasks and expect follow-up instructions to complete it unless the user explicitly says “continue later” or similar.

7 always remember that now this is gonna be a dynamic site  that will run on xampp environment so it can handle my backend

- You can @ files here
- You can use markdown but dont have to
